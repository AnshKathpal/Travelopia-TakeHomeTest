# Toggle Feature for Description Shortening

# Overview
This project aims to improve the conversion rate of a website on smaller screens by implementing a toggle feature to dynamically shorten the description content. The idea is to display a brief description by default and allow users to toggle between the short and full descriptions. This approach is expected to increase the visibility of the Call To Action (CTA) sections and encourage users to book a Tour.
